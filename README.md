# OS Project 2

## Summary

This program simulates a bank using multithreading and semaphores in Python.  
The system includes 3 tellers and 50 customers. Tellers handle deposits and withdrawals, request manager approval when needed, and access a limited capacity safe. Customers enter through a door with limited capacity, wait in line, and interact with tellers using a synchronized handshake.  
The simulation demonstrates thread coordination, shared resource protection, and realistic concurrency control.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Place the simulation file in your working directory.
3. Open a terminal in that directory.
4. Run the program using: python bank_sim.py

5. The program will print detailed logs showing all interactions between tellers and customers.
